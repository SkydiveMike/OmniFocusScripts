# OmniFocus Perspective Icons

By [Josh Hughes](http://josh-hughes.com)

**Note: Using these icons requires the Professional version of OmniFocus 3 for Mac or iOS or OmniFocus 2 for Mac**

I've developed a set of icons that is specifically designed to work well with [The Omni Group's OmniFocus software](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/). Feel free to use these icons for whatever you like (they are public domain!). I recommend using the [website for this project](https://omnifocusicons.josh-hughes.com) to install the icons. It's easier than navigating the folder structure here.

The OmniFocus 3 icons are all in the `v3` folder, while the OmniFocus 2 icons are in the `v2` folder. The `src` folder contains the Sketch source file for all of the icons.
