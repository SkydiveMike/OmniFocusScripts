(*
Use the following, in addition to any extra text, to create a custom date format (make sure to keep the simple quotes):

YEAR: "YYYY" - year with four digits (i.e., 2013), or "YY" - year with two digits (i.e., 13)
MONTH: "MMMM" - Month as text (i.e., June), "MMM" Month as text truncated to three letters (i.e., Jun), "MM" - Month with two digits using zero as padding (i.e., 06), or "M" - Month with no padding (i.e., 6)
DAY: "DD" - Day with two digits using zero as padding (i.e., 09), or "D" = Day without padding (i.e., 9)
WEEKDAY: "W" - Weekday as text (i.e., Monday)

# EXAMPLES (AS AT MONDAY, JUNE 17, 2013)

"YY-MM-DD" => "13-06-17"
"MMMM the D, YY" => "June the 17, 13"
"D/M/YYYY" => "17/6/2013"
