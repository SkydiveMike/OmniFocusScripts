# OmniLink

This might be useless after OmniFocus gets a URL scheme that can be opened like this: `omnifocus:///context/Home`, but OmniLink will get you do almost that.

You can pass in two arguments, say `context "Home & Family"`, and OmniLink will spit out a link like `omnifocus:///context/lkasoru092`.

If you pass a string to the script in LaunchBar, it will set the clipboard to the URL.

Also in this directory, you'll find a LaunchBar action that will return the URL inside of LaunchBar itself.
