# Conditionally

While OmniFocus may not have built-in "if foo then bar" capabilities, we can make a meta-task to handle those kinds of situations. This script will prompt you for an *If* clause if the task's name doesn't start with *If*. If it already does, it'll just remove the *If ~:* prefix. The script is ready to go for LaunchBar as well.
