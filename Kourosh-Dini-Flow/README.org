* OmniFocusScripts
I got the scripts in this folder from “Creating Flow with OmniFocus 3” by Kourosh Dini.
Brandon Pittman created the omnifocus.applescript Library, Kourosh updated the version
here for OmniFocus 3 compatibility.

I chose to pull in the GitHub version of the original (a copy I forked) and added a
Makefile based compile and install for it. I did remove ~omnifocus.scpt~ from this
director.

See ~~../OmniFocusScripts-BrandonPittman/OmniFocus Library/~ for the original source
librry.

* Remaining Scripts
- Makefile :: I added a Makefile to compile scripts from ~.applescript~ and to complete installs
- ~Engage.applescript~ :: Decompiled from ~Engage.scpt~
- ~gotolink.applescript~ :: Decompiled from ~gotolink.scpt~

* License
MIT - for my scripts and edits to existing scripts. Other scripts retain their original
license.
