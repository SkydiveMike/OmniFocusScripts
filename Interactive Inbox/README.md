# Interactive Inbox

This script will cycle through all the tasks in your inbox present you with a list of projects for each one. After it sets a project for each one, it will clean up the inbox and display a notification letting you know how many tasks remain in the inbox. It doesnâ€™t set contexts currently, but that might be something I add in the future.
